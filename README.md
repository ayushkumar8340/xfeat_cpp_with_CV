## Prerequisite

In this project, the following packages are used. Make sure the right versions of libraries are installed and linked.

1. Tested in Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04
2. Nvidia-driver-535 and CUDA Toolkit 12.2
3. gcc and g++ compilers 11.4.0
4. CMake 3.22.1 / 3.5
5. OpenCV 4.5.4 / 4.1.1
6. [libtorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch): Please avoid using the pre-built version of libtorch since it will cause linking issues ([CXX11 ABI issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/13541))

## Setup

To download the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/udaysankar01/xfeat_cpp
cd xfeat_cpp
```

To install the necessary packages (OpenCV and libtorch):

```bash
chmod +x project_setup.sh
./project_setup.sh
```

To build the project:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
To build the project using Docker
```bash 
sudo docker build -t xfeat .
xhost + (in different terminal)
./run_docker.sh xfeat
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Running

To perform matching between two images, use this command:

```bash
./build/examples/example /absolute/path/to/image1 /absolute/path/to/image2
```

Matching Example:

```bash
./build/examples/match $(pwd)/ref.png $(pwd)/tgt.png
```

Realtime Matching Example:

```bash
./build/examples/realtime_demo
```

Realsense Matching Example:

```bash
./build/realsense_demo
```
